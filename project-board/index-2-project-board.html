                <h1>Project: Making Longboarding More Popular</h1>
                <h2>A project with HU Utrecht University of Applied Sciences & Rocket Longboards.</h2>
                <h3>EDUCATION / UX-PROCESS / UX MANAGEMENT</h3>
                <p><strong>Project Information:</strong><br>
                    Clients: Hogeschool Utrecht (University of Applied Sciences), G|Bomb Longboards LLC & Rocket Longboards<br>
                    Sector: Sports & Education<br>
                    My Role: Product Owner<br>
                    Project Duration: 8 weeks (Feb-March 2018) 
                </p>

        <div class="content-item">
                <p><strong>Project Background:</strong><br>
                    I got the chance to work on this project due to a random encounter with a teacher of the B.Sc. Communication and Multimedia Design in the train. 
                    He was curious about my longboard, which, to me, functions as my daily transport. I explained a bit about my background and then the teacher asked if I 
                    would be interested in doing a design project with his second-year students and two other teachers. I could link the student teams to one of my 
                    longboarding contacts (Rocket Longboards) and the students could start working on generating ideas to make longboarding more popular in the Netherlands. 
                    I was responsible for guiding the students through relevant materials/information about the topic, helping them during the process and communicating the 
                    results to the involved company Rocket Longboards. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Goals & Scope of the Project:</strong><br>
                    The goal for the students was to learn more about the design process and to get more experience with doing projects for real companies and picture editing. 
                    Minimum Viable Products have to be ready and presented 6 weeks after the start. 
                    My personal goal was to learn more about the entire field of UX and webdesign (since I was studying ecology at the time, I wanted to know more about a different 
                    field of my interest). I wanted to improve my presentation & consultation skills, learn about project management and Agile. The goal of Rocket Longboards as an 
                    involved company was to get relevant material and ideas in any format to make longboarding more popular and possibly improve marketing and increase sales of a 
                    particular deck (the Exodus). In this case study, we'll only look at the group called ,,Fifty-Fifty" that came up with the clearest idea and the best overall performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Phase 1: Briefing & Brainstorming</strong><br>
                    I prepared a presentation about longboarding in general, the involved company and products and about the exact topic of the project: making longboarding more popular 
                    in the Netherlands. Then, the students were distinguished in groups and they could start with a Debriefing of my presentation and a brainstorm about possible ideas to 
                    reach the project goal.

                <p>
                    <strong>Phase 2: User Research, Building Empathy & Interviews</strong><br>
                    The group made a research plan to interview other students and travellers on the campus in Utrecht to get an idea of how the target group thought about longboarding in
                     general. It was not a representative study, but we got a good overview about how our target audience thinks about skating. The research findings were summarized in a 
                     persona and an infographic. The overall idea about longboarding seemed to be neutral and people don't really see it as a competitive sport, mainly because they don't 
                     know anything about the existing race events that actually take place all over the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The target audience has a relatively broad age category with 16-28 years of age. According to the research, students usually see longboarding as a recreative 
                    (non-competitive) sport or as a mode of transportation. This insight opens doors for marketing ideas and price range estimations for new products.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Phase 3: Concept Ideas & Sketches</strong><br>
                    Based on the research findings, the group "Fifty-Fifty" developed the following concept idea: developing a community of skating students throughout the country. 
                    Longboarding should be something fun that you can do in your free time to stay physically healthy, but also to combat loneliness among students (mental health). 
                    The community should be a way to meet new friends and explore the region where you live. The first logo's and brand names were designed. The name of the community 
                    would be "Go Skate" and the main target audience consists of sportive students aged 18-28 in the Netherlands. My role was to aid the students with the style of skaters 
                    and what appeals to them according to my experience and the materials I've gained over the years.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The concept idea of the student group was to promote longboarding in the "Uitweek". This is the first week of studies for the new first-years in the Netherlands. 
                    All kinds of activities are organized to let the students meet new people and get to know their new city. This is the perfect week to promote a relatively unknown 
                    sportive activity to a lot of people in our target group.

                 <p>
                    <strong>Phase 4: Media Plan & Style Guide</strong><br>
                    The brand and community "Go Skate" had to be marketed and for that, a style guide for multimedia applications was developed. Here the usage of the logo, typography, 
                    colors and layout on media like posters, webpages, brochures and more are discussed. To ensure consistent marketing, a media plan was made. Here the students have made 
                    an overview of what has to be posted when and where. A budget planning was also included to give an idea of the costs of the idea. 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Phase 5: Photo Sessions & Editing</strong><br>
                    The group wanted to have own pictures for the site layout and the Instagram channel, so we planned a few sessions to get pictures from different angles and edited the 
                    pictures. This was also a good opportunity for Rocket Longboards to get some quality pictures for an advertisement in the longboard magazine "Concrete Wave Magazine". 
                    The pictures were also used by G|Bomb Longboards for their Facebook page and for a post about a longboarding event in the city of Breda.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    <strong>Phase 6: Touchpoints and Customer Journey  Map</strong><br>
                    To get more insight in the journeys the potential users, the students made a Customer Journey Map. The journey of potential new users is shown: how could they get to 
                    know about the Uitweek and the skate events? How do they feel and which touchpoints do they have? In this way we've created more insight in the user and which touchpoints 
                    are important to keep in mind.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Phase 7: Presentation & Wrap-Up</strong><br>
                        After about 8 weeks, the final results of the 6 iterations were presented. The concept idea for the Uitweek was done and the Minimum Viable Products were ready. 
                        My role here was to decide which student group had made the best project according to the university's requirements, the needs of the Product Owner (me) and the 
                        requirements of ROCKET Longboards. Then we graded the individual projects and sent the results to all stakeholders.

                        <strong>Phase 8: Reflection</strong><br>
                        After the project, the most important things we used were the pictures, the touchpoints and the User Journey Map. To execute the entire concept would be too much 
                        work for ROCKET Longboards or for me, but the things we used have been of good use. The longboard that was photographed is now one of the best-selling longboard 
                        decks of ROCKET Longboards and it's a favorite of a lot of people who skate long distances. I think this project has been a good help to achieve this.

                        An important learning for me was that not all students have a background in quantitative methodology and that I maybe expected too much from the research. 
                        In hindsight I could have given more tips for doing quantitative research to improve the numerical basis and the User Research on which the concept ideas were based. 
                        However, I think I did a good job on giving clear assignments, providing good communication with all involved stakeholders and achieving the goal of the project with 
                        the student groups.

                        Unfortunately, the time frame and the budget of this project were pretty limited. If we'd had more time, we would have...<br>
                        ... done more User Research with more people<br>
                        ... made paper prototypes of the site<br>
                        ... conducted Usability Testing on the designed website<br>
                        ... launched a small "awareness-campaign" to draw the attention of the target audience to the project.
